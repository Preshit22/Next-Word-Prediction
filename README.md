**Next Word Prediction Project**

Welcome to the Next Word Prediction Project! This project focuses on developing a next word prediction model, which uses language modeling techniques to predict the most probable word to follow a given sequence of words. The model aims to enhance user experience in writing and typing by providing accurate word suggestions based on context.

**Installation**

To run this project locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Next-Word-Prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained language model weights file from [here](link-to-weights-file) and place it in the project directory.

**Usage**

Once the installation is complete, you can use the project as follows:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the "Next Word Prediction.ipynb" file.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the pre-trained language model, preprocess the text data, and generate next word predictions.

**Dataset**

The model used in this project has been trained on a large corpus of text data. However, due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. If you wish to train the model from scratch, you will need to obtain a suitable dataset and follow the data preprocessing steps outlined in the notebook.
